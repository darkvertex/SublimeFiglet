SublimeFiglet
=============

A [Sublime Text][3] package to add in Big ASCII Lettering via [pyfiglet][2], a Python implementation of the original [Figlet][1] project. It looks like this (although you can select your font):


         ___      .___  ___.      ___      ________   __  .__   __.   _______    __
        /   \     |   \/   |     /   \    |       /  |  | |  \ |  |  /  _____|  |  |
       /  ^  \    |  \  /  |    /  ^  \   `---/  /   |  | |   \|  | |  |  __    |  |
      /  /_\  \   |  |\/|  |   /  /_\  \     /  /    |  | |  . `  | |  | |_ |   |  |
     /  _____  \  |  |  |  |  /  _____  \   /  /----.|  | |  |\   | |  |__| |   |__|
    /__/     \__\ |__|  |__| /__/     \__\ /________||__| |__| \__|  \______|   (__)


How to Use
==========

This Package adds three commands to the command palette:

* `Figlet: Add Text` lets you type text (or uses your selection) and figletizes it.

* `Figlet: Add Comment` lets you type text (or uses your selection) and figletizes it as a comment.

* `Figlet: Select Font` lets you choose a font out of the installed list that come with pyfiglet. See a list of the font styles at the [figlet font page](http://www.figlet.org/examples.html).

Afterwards, go to Preferences->Package Control, pick "Install Package" from the menu, wait a second and type in "figlet" to find this package in the list. Press Enter to confirm installation. That's it!
